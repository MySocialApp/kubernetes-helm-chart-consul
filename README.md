# Kubernetes Helm Chart for Consul

You can find here a helm chart we're using at [MySocialApp](https://mysocialapp.io) (iOS and Android social app builder - SaaS)

We're using this chart on bare metal with local storage. We recommend that consul servers are used with "Node Selector" option to stick to specific servers.

This chart support:
* Bootstrap
* Upgrade
* Recovery on node restart
